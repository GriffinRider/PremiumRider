Update Patch Notes
1.0 – First Release

1.01 – Nerfed break to Super Treasure Zone from 100k to 90k and disabled Exotic Dragons from being the guard to it to ensure the fight to be more fair
(Faerie Dragons could just erase half army and fortress cows could shred thru Azures)

1.02 – Buffed monster joining for gold with diplomacy skill from 50% to 75%
Disabled obelisks from spawning anywhere but in Super Treasure Zones
Changed hero pool (bugged)

1.12 – CHANGES MADE DUE TO NEW HOTA UPDATE 1.7.2
Skills removed: Archery, Intelligence
Skills added: First Aid, Pathfinding
Artifacts removed: Pendant of Negativity, all Statue of Legion parts and Bow of the Sharpshooter
Artifacts added: Armor of the Damned (assembled), Equestrian Gloves and all interference artifacts
Heroes removed: Sanya, Caitlin (castle was nerfed too much), Ryland, Alamar, Boragus, Alkin, Grindan (worse than other avalaible heroes), Thunar (was in the template to make shitters into usable unit, but its time for fish now)
Heroes added: Rion, Christian, Gem, Arlach, Floribert (artillery/first aid spec), Mutare, Lacus (big buffs to spec), Adrienne (there's still not enough magic wells for her to be broken)

1.13 - Disabled Interference skill - it is useless when armies are so big
Treasure zones' terrain connected to your starting biome, can't be sand/snow or swamp anymore - to not punish those who didn't get Pathfinding skill
Fixed bug with Box Super Zones towns not matching the faction
